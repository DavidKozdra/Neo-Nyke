# Koz Engine Integration

Use this file as the entry point for embedding the engine in a game.

## Boundary

- Engine modules own reusable mechanics and contracts.
- The host owns characters, balance values, DOM IDs, art, authored rooms, story, and platform bootstrapping.
- Connect the two through injected callbacks, adapters, content tables, or `Core/extensionHost.js`.

## Composition

```js
const { createExtensionHost } = require('./Core/extensionHost');
const extensions = createExtensionHost();

extensions.registerService('audio', gameAudio);
extensions.registerAdapter('rooms', roomAdapter);
extensions.registerContent('enemies', enemyDefinitions);
extensions.registerComponent('hud.preview', HudPreview);
```

Create a scoped host for tests, scenes, or game modes. Scoped registrations override their parent without mutating it.

## Recommended Load Order

1. Core, Time, Events, and deterministic random services.
2. Project/content schemas and adapters.
3. Combat, AI, World, Items, and Economy systems.
4. Audio, VisualFX, Rendering3D, and UI presentation.
5. Host content and host bootstrap.
