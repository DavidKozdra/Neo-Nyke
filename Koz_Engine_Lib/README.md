# Koz Engine Lib

`Koz_Engine_Lib` is the reusable, game-agnostic engine layer.

It is useful today, but it is still **transitional** rather than a finished standalone package.

## Start Here

If you are new to the engine, read these first:

1. [new-user-guide.md](docs/new-user-guide.md)
2. [module-catalog.md](docs/module-catalog.md)
3. the module source under each folder for real usage examples

## What This Folder Is Trying To Guarantee

The intended boundary is:

1. The engine must not know which game is using it.
2. A game may depend on the engine.
3. The engine may not depend on any specific game.

## Current State

The export-decoupling pass is largely done, but the engine is not fully clean yet.

What remains:

- some engine files still reference game globals, DOM, p5, or save/UI runtime details
- a few files in this folder are still better described as "candidate engine code" than stable engine API
- the browser global bridge still exists as temporary host glue
- export format is still mixed across the folder during migration

See [module-catalog.md](docs/module-catalog.md) for the current per-module guidance and caveats.

## Good First Modules

If you want modules that are easiest to understand and safest to reuse first, start with:

- `Core/gameStateManager.js`
- `Core/spatialGrid.js`
- `Core/uiScreenController.js`
- `SaveLoad/*`
- `Time/countdownTimer.js`
- `Time/dayNightCore.js`
- `Events/eventEngine.js`
- `Events/notificationManager.js`
- `Events/tipTracker.js`
- `UI/mobileInput.js`
- `World/*` except game-specific host composition
- `Economy/stagedAcquisition.js`
- `Items/itemFactory.js`
- `Audio/*`
- `VisualFX/particleSystemCore.js`

## Modules To Treat As Host-Coupled

These are documented, but they are not the right first stop for new users:

- `Events/eventSystem.js`
- `Events/notificationManager.js`
- `Time/dayNightCycle.js`
- `Minigames/minigamesRuntime.js`
- `Assets/atlasHelper.js`
- `VisualFX/particleSystem.js`
- `VisualFX/flightPath.js`
- `AI/AI.js`
- `AI/Charictar_controller.js`
- `Core/GameObject.js`

## How To Read The Folder

- `README.md`: project boundary and current status
- `docs/new-user-guide.md`: fastest onboarding path
- `docs/module-catalog.md`: what each module does today

## Final Rules

Modules in `Koz_Engine_Lib` should eventually follow these rules:

1. Export code only. No global namespace mutation.
2. No direct `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, or p5 dependency in engine modules.
3. No game-specific nouns, globals, content tables, or screen logic.
4. Host-specific bootstrapping belongs in a separate bootstrap/composition layer.
5. Content packs belong to the game, not the engine.

## Target Folder Names

The active folder structure should be explicit:

- `AI/`: pathfinding and agent-support logic
- `Assets/`: asset lookup and atlas registry helpers
- `Audio/`: reusable audio services
- `Core/`: generic runtime primitives and bootstrap entrypoints
- `Economy/`: reusable staged ownership/economy helpers
- `Events/`: generic event rules, notification helpers, and tutorial/tip tracking
- `Items/`: generic item math and registries
- `Minigames/`: minigame orchestration and runtimes
- `SaveLoad/`: save/load APIs, drivers, and schemas
- `Time/`: clocks, timers, and day-cycle helpers
- `UI/`: renderer-agnostic UI primitives
- `UI/mobileInput.js`: touch/input math and gesture helpers
- `VisualFX/`: reusable visual (FX) logic
- `World/`: deterministic world space, world-generation helpers, and editor-facing world tools

Removed vague buckets:

- `api/`
- `io/`
- `progression/`
- `browser/`

See [module-catalog.md]

## What Does Not Belong Here

- game-specific UI flow
- host game globals
- game save orchestration
- DOM input wiring
- p5 rendering behavior

## Short Principle

If a new game could not use a module without learning another game's internals, that module is not ready to live in `Koz_Engine_Lib`.
